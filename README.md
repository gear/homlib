# homlib --- Homomorphism Counting Algorithm

## Description

A C++ implementation of homomorphism counting algorithm.

## Algorithm

It is a dynamic programming on tree decomposition.

- For tree decomposition, it uses the greedy heuristics.
- For homomorphism counting, I implemented [1].

## Usage

````
from homlib import Graph, hom
T = Graph(3)
T.addEdge(0,1)
T.addEdge(1,2)

G = Graph(3)
G.addEdge(0,1)
G.addEdge(1,2)
G.addEdge(2,0)

print(hom(T, G))
````
